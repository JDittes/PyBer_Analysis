# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
I was hired to do an exploritory analysis on files relating to PyBer rideshares over the course of 2019. I learned to use pandas and matploglib to create charts to explain the relationships between the number of rides, the total of fares, and the types of areas Pyber served (rural, suburban, and urban). The data and graphs will be used for planning and allocation of resources: to predict high times, and to ensure that drivers are available to each type of town.

## Results:
When we compare the ride-sharing data among city types one fact stands out above all others: the lion's share of the rides are booked within urban areas. More than 2/3rds of the total rides are booked within urban areas![Figure 6](https://github.com/JDittes/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Fig6.png)

But while urban areas are where the rides are, that is not necessarily where the profits are. When we look at the percentage of total fares by city type, we see the urban share of the fares drops by 6% of the total, made up for by fares in suburban areas, which increas by more than 4%, and the remainder from rural fares.![Figure 5](https://github.com/JDittes/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Fig5.png)

The number of drivers is even more skewed by city type than the share of rides and fares. More than 80% of the drivers work in Urban areas, while only 3% work in rural areas, and 16& work in suburban areas. This has a significant effect on fare.![Figure 6](https://github.com/JDittes/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Fig4.png)

The effect on fares is significant. Average driver fares are much higher in rural and suburban areas

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the, total drivers, , average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
