# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
I was hired to do an exploritory analysis on files relating to PyBer rideshares over the course of 2019. I learned to us pandas and matploglib to create charts to explain the relationships between the number of rides, the total of fares, and the types of areas they were provided (rural, suburban, and urban). The data and graphs will be used for planning and allocation of resources: to predict high times, and to ensure that drivers are available to each type of town.

## Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
